# Artifact Harvester Agent Specification

## Documentation Requirement

Every change to this codebase must include documentation that explains the reasoning behind the code you write. When implementing new functionality or modifying existing logic, accompany the code with comments, README updates, or other relevant docs that capture the intent, trade-offs, and usage guidance. This ensures future contributors can understand why decisions were made and how to work with the code safely.
